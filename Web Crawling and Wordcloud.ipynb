       "[' \"Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who\\'s been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final.\" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie\\'s main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey\\'s best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You\\'ll love it if you loved cricket. You\\'ll like it if you love good cinema. ',\n",
       " ' MS DHONI : THE UNTOLD STORY! AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT BY SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUTFrom the beginning of the movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop for a few moments! And they have not been wrong. I\\'m not highlighting the plot in detail as I\\'m pretty much interested not to unfold the story line as many of you will go to watch it.Let me talk about the best parts. First of all, Sushant\\'s tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. Next Anupam Kher and Rajesh Sharma rightly have adjusted themselves to their spots. Herry Tangri (Yuvi) excellently has scaled himself with his character. Kiara Advani (Sakshi), Disha Patani(Priyanka) have given their best too. Well, now I must talk about the cinematography, here Santosh Thundiyil has done a brilliant job. Especially Dhoni\\'s train capturing scene leaving his job and Dhoni\\'s coming out of the dressing room scene during the World Cup (2011) Final help a lot to excel this film. Undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has. As a director Neeraj Pandey is of course successful but somewhere it has lacked a bit of his special touch. Though it doesn\\'t matter because you will not find a single moment that can make you bore. The story has real gravity and it successfully has followed the tag line i.e \"The man you know... The journey you don\\'t\". Truly it has focused on his journey- his struggle, ups and downs etc. The dialogues are very inspiring and heart-touching at many places. It is around 190mins\\' movie. You may think it\\'s quite long but trust me after watching it you\\'ll think if it could be of 5 hours that would have been perfect.... Even the Dhoni-haters can\\'t deny that.. Actually there\\'s so much to tell about. Anyway, let\\'s come to the background sound... Truly effective though at some points it could have been better. Except that the editing has been done quite well but truly it\\'s the place where it has lacked a bit. At few points it seems to be less glued... sudden turn of the movements and emotions is visible. And another important part is the story line which is of course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed. It would have been much more better if there\\'s a bit more details about few facts like Wicket Keeping, Yuvi, Dressing Room situation after the WC2011 Final. But still it\\'s fine as I have said earlier that it has focused more on Dhoni as a man.. especially his journey... Otherwise it is actually excellent... Or better to say super-excellent! And oh yes casting is just amazing.So finally I would like to conclude like this. If you wish to watch it don\\'t wait for the review just go for it. One thing I can assure you that you will not regret for a moment. But you may regret if you don\\'t watch it or watch it by downloading from internet. If possible for you to spend some money please try that to give your respect to the hard works done by the cast and crew. I don\\'t feel like giving marks to this movie as it may look disrespecting but taking it as a work of art I\\'m giving 9/10. Please don\\'t listen to someone else if you feel like going then go...!!P.S - I respect you, Sushant Singh Rajput... Your career is going to get a big hike after this. \\'Excellent\\' is just a word for you.Caution - You may find yourself in out-of-air-condition while the last scene happens, in spite of knowing the upcoming. ;) :)N.B- If a second part of it comes out, I\\'ll not be surprised. There are lot more facts deserve to get unfolded. ',\n",
       " \" I am a dhoni fan but this movie is beyond fans of dhoni or fans of cricket... For general audience this will be a movie that's not just a treat but also a complete package... Coming back to fans of cricket! This is India.. And we like to idolise legends... The very fact that we can see the demi-gods we worship on a 100mm screen is surreal. There are moments were the theatre here in Chennai goes berserk.. The kind of reception the demi- gods of Tamil cinema get! I completely had the feeling of a thalaivar movie ... Each aspect of dhoni's life brilliantly portrayed in a way respectable to the man and to his colleagues.The way the movie teaches us that hard work can only pave way to success is taken . congratulations to the whole team... It was an experience which cannot be worded in a 1000 words limit given by IMDb. For a movie to have an explosive climax the middle order is the setup point... That's y the director chose to pace the love scenes just around the interval and then the last scene where the earth shattering response is still being felt by me after 12 hours... A dedication to a Legend... The Demi God I shall say! \",\n",
       " \" M.S. Dhoni had a burden of expectations on it - not just because it is based on India's most beloved captain but also it had Neeraj Pandey as Director. The movie is well made but runs into too much of unnecessary stuff, especially in the second half. It is pretty much left on its own in the later part. Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions. Story (7/10): The movie focused really well on the life of MSD before he became a household name. It focused a lot on the challenges, small town boys had been facing to get an entry into Indian cricket team about 10 years back when metro boys, especially Delhi and Mumbai, had a great influence on the team composition. What I also loved was the portrayal of Dhoni's work ethic - be it the scene of Yuvraj Singh or the booze. The first half of the story shows the tremendous amount of research done on the build up of MSD and the people involved in getting him into the Indian cricket team. Unfortunately, the story is left orphaned once it crosses that chapter. Too much focus on his love life was not just unnecessary but also slowed down the movie tremendously. I would have loved to see some focus on what exactly made him CAPTAIN COOL and at least some bits of behind the scenes portrayal of what happened in the dressing room in the 2011 WC Final. But the story just skips through that, which is a big let down. Acting (10/10): Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. This would definitely go in as one of his best performances, arguably better than Byomkesh Bakshi. What I loved was the effort and the screen presence by the supporting cast - especially MSD's friend circle and also his school coach, played by Rajesh Sharma. The last time I saw such a level of presence by supporting cast was, perhaps, in Tanu Weds Manu series.Direction (6/10): This was definitely below par performance of Neeraj Pandey, considering his reputation. While a lot of research and meticulousness went into the first half of the movie, it was equally misdirected and vague in the second half. The story pretty much ended at the point when MSD makes it into the Indian cricket team. I felt Neeraj Pandey tends to play safe and is compelled to add romance element irrespective of the movie genre, just like he did in Baby and Special 26 where, again, it wasn't required at all. And this is what takes down this movie. While three hours is pretty much expected in biopic movies, he didn't utilize it to the best. Overall (7/10): It lives up to its tagline - The Untold Story - with some great research on the life of MSD in his early years but the movie just becomes directionless in the second half. But still, a good movie to watch, at least half of it. \",\n",
       " \" After 3 films with Akshya Kumar as lead, Neeraj Pandey switched over to Sushant Singh Rajput and made this movie based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.First of all, to make a biopic is not an easy job. As what the maker finds interesting, the person on which the biopic is happening may not! He wants something to show, but the maker is not convince with that. These are some basic differences. And after all this, a movie should be a true entertainer. So, the toughest part for the maker is to decide what to show &amp; how to show. Because the maker has to give pure justice to the person's life without hurting his fans and followers.Neeraj starts the film with the 2011 world cup final. And when Dhoni enters in the ground, Neeraj switches of to the flashback. From this point, the film picks up the speed. From the birth of Dhoni, to his schooling, to his relationship with his sister, to his caring mother &amp; strict father, to his friendships, to his matches, to his practice, to his breakdown where he gets to know that he can't play Dulip Trophy, to his disregarding by selectors, to his job as a TC, to his hard work, to his self realization and getting into the train. Every single scene is running like a fast paced balling delivery. The 50% of the film is complete and than you realize that one hour and thirty minutes are over.In post interval, love story starts with Ind-Pak series. Some beautiful tracks and little lighter moments are there in love segments. But as compare to the first half, this is not that much in speed. But you don't feel like boring. And than Sakshi's entry, Dhoni's marriage, and back to the first scene and completes the circle with winning six in the final of 2011 world cup.Lyrics by Manoj Muntshir and Music by Amaal Malik are fantastic. Besabriyaan is my favorite along with the soulful track Kaun Tujhe. The entire album suits to the film. We have noticed in Neeraj's movie, that one background tune which has been constantly played throughout the film. In this movie too, one outstanding tune is there.Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh &amp; Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.But the man, Sushant Singh Rajput is a true actor. After delivering a classic performance in last year's Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, he shines out this time too. As a lead, his dedication towards becoming Dhoni is fantastic. From gaining the weight as Dhoni to setting a hairstyle like him, he just delivered his best. His 150 days of cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes the ball with a helicopter shot. He is a real actor of today's generation.Now, what to say about Neeraj! I love all his films. I've seen Baby and Special 26 more than 20 times. And I like this one too. So, whenever I'll get chance, will surely watch this again and again.On the whole, after collecting 20cr on the first day, the movie will fly high at box office. Without any promotions on TV, without any major star casts, this film is doing well, and there are two reasons- Dhoni and Neeraj Pandey. Public is smart and they know on whom they can trust. So, just go and see the film. A pure entertainer of this year. Get inspiration from Dhoni's life and his hard-work.And one more request, please cheer up the hall. As I've seen some snapchat videos where the hall is silent even on the winning stroke. I'm lucky that the hall where I went was so enthusiastic to see this film, that every single stoke of Dhoni or even Gambhir or Yuvraj got applause. Some glimpse of Sachin, Sehwag or any other cricketer also got appreciation by the audience. In my life, I've heard cheers on a six or four in the cinema-hall rather than a stadium. These things made my day. Best movie experience of this year so far.By far, my most favorite biopic film is Bhag Milkha Bhag. And after that, I guess this film. \",\n",
       " ' As far as the story-line is concerned - this biopic feels like a MS Dhoni promotion. It just shows the positives of his life - leaves out all the controversies. In short - it feels like a biopic written by a MS Dhoni fan.But, at the same time, the acting and direction are amazing. The cricket scenes feel real and you can feel the emotions. Yet, it does suffer due to bad editing. Some scenes are stretched too long, and the songs just drag the movie to the 3hr length.Overall - it deserves 6/10 - for acting, direction, and lastly, for MS Dhoni! ',\n",
       " ' First of all hats off to Niraj Pandey for selecting this story, as it inspires each and everyone who struggles in their life We all know dhoni as a successful cricketer, but if you want to know the reason behind his success, then this movie is must for you. Sushant shing has done a great job.One of the best ever sports based films ever made. In fact, this film is not only about guts and glory, but dwells into topics much deeper than that. Neeraj Pandey delivers yet another masterpiece. The duration of the movie is big let-down, and the director could have cut down on those unnecessary songs, which slow down the pace of the movie. The entire movie is capped off by a brilliant ending. Sushant was absolutely brilliant and flawless in the movie, thus adding yet another feather to his already highly decorated cap. All the other actors too have played their parts. On the whole, this movie was not only an entertainer but also keeps you hooked to it for a good three hours. And rarely has a Bollywood movie been this good. Truly an inspiring movie... Hats off to the entire team for creating such a masterpiece !!!! ',\n",
       " ' Right now maybe everyone should agree on this, Neeraj Pandey is one of the most talented directors of the Bollywood. He has made some outstanding films and this is also a very good film. His all of the films are thriller genre and he is right now a master of the thriller movie. His previous ventures \"A Wednesday\", \"Special 26\" and \"Baby\" all of this 3 movies are highly appreciated by the critics and the audiences. This movie is not a complete thriller movie, Moreover this movie is a biography. But just you think when biography meets with the thriller genre, what will happen? Exactly!!! A very good enjoyable movie. This movie has all the elements what you like to watch. Sports, Drama, Emotion, Action, Suspense and thriller. the perfect combination of all of this.I am not revealing the story of this movie. You all know Mr. Mahendra Sing Dhoni. He is the captain of Indian Cricket team of Limited version. You know his career in cricket and you know his contribution to Indian cricket. But you don\\'t know his untold story and how he came here and how he made his fame. This is a very emotional journey and very encourageable for everyone.We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don\\'t want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. I am not telling the story but you may think biography movie is not enjoyable. But believe me, this movie will demolish your previous experience about this genre and definitely you will enjoy this. Good storyline, Very good script, Outstanding direction and very good acting made this a good enjoyable one. If you feel bored after watching Raaz 4 and Pink, go catch this movie. You will not regret. ',\n",
       " \" Thriller specialist Neeraj Pandey tried new genre Biopic with exceptionally brilliant manner.This one showcase the struggle of small town boy against all odds in his journey. Sushant Singh Rajput played tremendous match winning performance.He molded himself as middle class struggling young man to world conqueror. In first half, Neeraj has good grip on script but second half was slightly slow due to love stories and songs. Neeraj's favorite actor Anupam Kher was outstanding in the role of careful father. Anupam was part of each outing with Neeraj e.g. A Wednesday(Police commissioner), Special 26(P. K. Sharma) and last one Baby(Om Prakash Shukla).Disha looks cute in her role. Kaira was good in role of Sakshi. Rajesh Sharma,Kumud Mishra and Sarvadaman D.Banerjee were terrific. Herry Tangiri was really awesome choice for role of Yuvraj Singh.Script, Dialogue and Execution made it must watch for Cinema lover. \",\n",
       " \" DHONI - The Guy and WithinA quiet winter morning, the sun barely able to make its presence felt through the haze. A small second floor flat in a building desperately asking for a makeover after the elapsed monsoons. A few pigeons eating out of the hands of a child hanging out in the balcony. This is a typical moment in the lives of millions who inhabit the so called 'small towns' in India. Yet, this was the start of a journey, for a person called Mahi.An avid goal keeper in school, whose 'dodging the ball' skills were spotted and honed into a successful wicket keeper by his teacher. Every successful face has a story to say. Rarely do we get to know facets of people whom we idolize. M S Dhoni \\x96 The untold story, is an endeavor to try and unveil a few pages of his life and give a peek behind the face of Dhoni, into his heart and mind.Many anecdotes we may know of and recall, but then so many we don't. Interesting to witness those. Not to forget all those who played such a vital role in shaping him as an individual, prodding him on as a sportsman and helping him groom and grow. The movie gives due credit to all those.The movie tends to go back and forth a bit as if unable to choose whether to show his cricket prowess or peek into his personal life. Sushant Singh Rajput seems to have worked hard in impersonating him on field. And the ladies in his life showcased by two new faces have done a commendable job in this film. Am sure will be spotted by noted talent spotters after this. That's going out for Kiara Advani and Disha Patani. Wishing you'll the very best.Anupam Kher, Rajesh Sharma (hehehe my name sake), Bhumika Chawla and others have done a good job. A good learning for all the kids. Perseverance, dedication and the will to succeed can get you places. And can make you who you are destined to be, not merely who you might choose to be.Critical review of the movie am leaving to those who are best at it. Here are only highlighted reasons why you should see it. Just 35 years of age. Yet so much to share. That's Mahi or Dhoni for you. Go see, feel, live a slice of his life, for that's what you will manage in about 3 hours when they try and capture a lifetime of experiences. @rajrad \",\n",
       " \" Director Mr. Neeraj Pandey work is very good. He chose the up to date way of narrating this story by designing continuous shots taking rather that choosing conventional and beaten way of long, mid and close . This new style was much needed for this sports drama film. This way you get the correct feel of on screen happenings but in starting half an hour camera work doesn't support director's vision well. It gets blurred while panning and soft while moving but after that it is almost good. Story is based on M.S.Dhoni real life so nothing to say about it. Screenplay by Director himself and Arun Jha is very good. They have never gone overboard or tried to dramatize the scenes unnecessary. There are so many cute and crisp scenes, like Dhoni talking on disconnected telephone and even this scene has a good culmination ahead. Another major plus point of this film is its unusual but sweet love scenes, like the intro of Priyanka, Dhoni first love interest, then intro of Sakshi, both scenes are too good. Sakshi talking to her roommate is also appropriate and cute, establishing and taking forward her character when Dhoni says that I knew you wouldn't come alone to meet me. This film has very strong emotional quotient too and after long time rain in emotional scenes didn't irritate me. Dialogues are very good. The way Khadagpur railway officer Mr. Ganguly, a very fine actor, describes aspects of life to Dhoni as reference of cricket is outstanding. Editing needs to be especially mentioned. Editor Mr Shree Narayan Singh has delivered a fine and seamless work. The way of blending the real footage and reel one is just amazing. Without showing all the stalwarts on screen you never feel that they are not present. All shots are so quick. Credit goes to Director too for his vision. Without taking any names in some disputed angle they ably make you understand everything. This film is full of performance surprises. Credit goes to casting director Vicky Sadana. Sushant Singh Rajput is mind blowing. You have to pay extra attention that he is not real Dhoni. He has not done this by imitating but adding fine dimension to his character so you think that if real one would be in this situation. He would have reacted in same way. Disha Patani as Priyanka is very endearing and acts well too. Kiara Advani as Sakshi is very good. She shines in an emotional scene. There are lots of great actors too. Anupam Kher (Father), Mother (good actress), Bhumika Chawla( Sister), Rajesh Sharma (Sports teacher Banerjee), Kumud Mishra (Coal mines officer), all are pitch perfect. Actors in role of his friends are also very good, like Kranti Prakash Jha as Santosh, Chittu shows his caliber in the scene when he conveys the sad news to Dhoni over phone. Actor who played Sardar ji is also perfect. Music by Amaal Mallik, goes well with film but lyrically all tracks are heavy. Manoj Muntanshir's lyric Like Mukhda 'Mal De Suraj Ke Munh Par Malai, Burbak Badal Par Kar De Chadhai', I liked it but Antra becomes preachy. I missed some simple lyrical melodious tracks, which scope was in film. \",\n",
       " \" As a huge fan of MS right from the time of very first substantial score that he made in 2005, there's this pretty much impossible desire to meet him, to get to know him a a personal level, even if for five minutes it may be. Having watched this film and to have through it got to know so many of the untold things about him and his life, it feels as if that wish has been fulfilled, right here at my own place. I was so sure of it being a good film that I got photos clicked of myself whilst the starting scenes ran on the TV. Just for the memories.When Sushant walks in to bat in the very beginning, the film completely over-takes my whole being and from then on it becomes a journey, a ride, an atmosphere that you live with him. I thought Emraan did tremendously as Azharuddin in 'Azhar' (2016), but Sushant was equally impressive and in fact mind-blowing at copying MS' style, his stroke-play, the walk to the wicket and the trigger movements on the way. I noticed that black spot too below the left eye, that MS has. The beginning and the ending scenes themselves are worth millions and a piece of very intelligent film-making to evoke the emotions of the public.It was very emotional, any angle you look at it from; whether from the hard-work that he'd to put in, the set-backs he's had to suffer on the way, or the achievements he went on to make. What stands above all is the the tragic death of his girlfriend in a car crash, whilst he was playing cricket in another country (there're differing reports as to when it happened. Some say it was whilst he went on a tour for the India A team).The most fun part of course was discovering how and from whom he learnt the helicopter shot, a shot that signifies the man's unorthodox character. I find it very heartening on his part to have given someone else the deserved credit for his trademark shot.Despite MS' request against it, some over the top glorification is always expected, given that films need heroes, and so too is the minor tweaking of the details and the timings of the events, but it remains overall a pretty solid film that I can watch again and again, and can't help but place it amongst my all-time favourites. So a big thumbs up to everyone involved!Also, during his career itself, the film serves as a timely reminder for those of his critics who always credit his success as captain to him being just lucky. We may not like a sportsman, or criticise him, but we should respect the hard-work put in by anyone of them to have reached it to the highest levelDetailed write-up: http://textuploader.com/d5jx2 \",\n",
       " ' the movie is superb.i don\\'t want to tell story of this movie.but i can say this movie is going to do something in film industry.The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done.

I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey\\'s best hour in cinema.

The movie scene in which Sushant Singh Rajput hits the ball for six over long on is so terrific that u will actually feel that the 2011 world cup final is going on in the cinema hall. U will relieve the moment once again in your life. The commitment and dedication level of Sushant Singh Rajput is fantastic. U will never see someone work as hard as he did for a movie.

       " ' I was quite excited for the film, so much that I didn\\'t wanted to read the reviews and went for the first day show. The reason for the excitement was to see the most celebrated Indian captain, MS Dhoni being played by a talented actor, Sushant Singh Rajput and Neeraj Pandey directing it after Baby. After leaving the Cinema hall, I wasn\\'t bored but I was disappointed. The fact which disappointed me was that Neeraj didn\\'t took any risk The Film covers the life of MS Dhoni from his birth to the day when he lifts the World Cup in 2011. The Teenage-Youth years are well portrayed and is the main strength of the film. Hats off to Neeraj for the details of 90\\'s like Children carrying the rectangular shaped bags, Playing the video games. The locations are real and that\\'s another positive of the film. You travel to the unseen city of Ranchi, visits Dhoni\\'s real school and see the various grounds. Sushant\\'s dedication to be Dhoni, to play like Dhoni, to look like Dhoni is outstanding. Yes, he mastered the popular Helicopter Shot. Another thanks to the Visual Effects team cause they beautifully shelved Sushant\\'s body into a teenage one and to fit his face into Dhoni\\'s Match Footage(Not 100 percent accurate but it\\'s still good) The first Half is good as you see the character grow, the minor details and the help Dhoni gets from his friends, parents and coaches. But when you are really excited to see how Dhoni becomes a successful captain, the victories, the failures and the controversies, the screenplay let\\'s you down. The shift changes to Dhoni love life which is still good but then then it misses what really the viewer want to see.We don\\'t get to see Dhoni becoming the captain, his response to it and how he let a young immature team to win T20 World cup in 2007. You don\\'t really get to know what makes Dhoni, An Amazing Captain. That\\'s why film becomes \"a Told Story\" rather than untold cause you know almost everything. Also I wanted the answer to how he manages to be cool in tough situations and Why he put himself up in the batting order in the World Cup 11 final but at the end all remained unanswered. Performance\\'s are good from the support cast too as Anupam Kher, Disha patni shines in their roles. So, what to do this weekend? You can still go, its not bad. The film has a heart and 180 minutes didn\\'t let you to sleep. It\\'s better than many biopics coming these days cause of the performance, research and details. But if you\\'re expecting for a film that makes it into your favorite list,it isn\\'t ',\n",
       " \" After watching Emraan Hashmi's Azhar, it came to my mind that Bollywood wasn't just ready to make a biopic, but this movie made my interest go up thanks to none other than Neeraj Pandey. M.S Dhoni is Neeraj Pandey's new movie starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The movie revolves around Dhoni's career and his relationships.Honestly, this film was outstanding. Sushant Singh Rajput deserves a bow for this. He played Dhoni so well that the gestures and skills he used in the movie were simply great. He is on his way of deserving for the Best Male Actor Award in the upcoming award festival. Even Anupam Kher, Disha Patani, and Kiara Davani were just simply phenomenal in their respective roles. The direction and music was simply brilliant and the tone was shifted very smoothly.But the only negative factor that I have for this movie is the script. I felt that this script was generic in terms of showing a documentary than a movie. The movie is suppose to have some funny moments and some outdated moments but I don't think the script had these elements. Overall, this film is great in terms of good performances, direction, and music. But the screenplay of the movie made it boring on some occasions but its still a great film. M.S Dhoni- The untold story is worth watching at a cinema near you. Neeraj Pandey and SSR- thank you for winning our hearts. \",\n",
       " ' It is said that leaders are not created rather they are born and such is the case with M.S.Dhoni. This real life based movie truly does justice to the hard work and commitment of Indian Cricket Captain and World Cup Winner M.S Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey has done a fabulous job to put up all the pieces in the desired sequence to create this masterpiece. Sushant Singh Rajput yet again impresses with his on screen performance and persona as everything about him is just perfect from head to toe in the movie. All the features starting from story, dialogues, cinematography, acting, music till direction is well knitted to form an impressive flick. However, the highlight remains Sushant Singh Rajput with his all the talent, skill and perfection doing full justice to the living legend of Indian cricket. It is quite visible that he has done a good research on Dhoni including his hair style, shyness, walking and famous \"Helicopter Shot\". The film outlines the struggle of M.S Dhoni from a railway ticket collector to the Captain of a World Champion team. It also highlights the issues pertaining to the changes made by him for transforming Indian Cricket team to a World Class Unit. The trend of making movies on real life events is gaining a lot of momentum in Bollywood and this one is the fresh addition to the list and probably the top of the line effort. M.S. Dhoni is already a star, living legend and a role model for cricketers all over the world and this film will surely add to his existing honor and prestige. A must watch film for those who believe in hard work, common man, fair play and M.S Dhoni!!!! ',\n",
       " \" From this biopic story youngsters' has a lot to learn how the strong determination power is important to achieve more then what other people expect from you and what are your capabilities. We ourselves are the best judge to evaluate our actual potential and we should never satisfy with underachieved goals. Excellent work by the team to portray the real story of MSD.A balanced dose of politics we sense in cricket with the ups and downs we see while we climb the pyramid.It was not a movie, which needs much of action and VFX work. So a good to see movie. \",\n",
       " ' First of all, the beginning was great. The story line was Awesome. However, the one million close ups of the actors faces started to become incredibly unbearable and ridiculous. Also, the love of his life gets hit by a car, and he lays in the middle of the road for 5 minutes, and then plays some cricket. This movie should have been an hour and a half, but it zoomed on their faces for an extra half of the movie. We finished it, only because we were so invested with our time and made it a challenge. I took extra in the bathroom to take a break. ',\n",
       " ' it is just awesome biopic movie.Ms, this name need no introduction for cricket lovers. This movie exact same life as ms real life.all actors have done great work and best director have a great direction of work.it is awesome to watch movie with such type of exactness.I like movie very much. ',\n",
       " \" A biopic is incredibly burdensome as a great degree of research is involved in the creative process. Such real stories can completely falter if the actual realities are poorly replicated on the silver screen. In addition, if a biopic does not display key details it doesn't really explore the realities accurately. Biopics can also largely misfire if the actualities are severely distorted. Neeraj Pandey's MS Dhoni: The Untold Story is not a backfire because it does not fall prey to these aforementioned issues. Essentially, it accurately shows MS Dhoni's legacy without spending an overdose of time on needless content; this is no hogwash.This film beautifully shows MS Dhoni's childhood, his passions, and his struggle. This film is several notches above Azhar(2016) because it has an eye for details. Dhoni's family's values are explored well through the initial scenes. In the initial stages, his slow and steady movement towards cricket via wicket-keeping is a delight to watch. His relationship with the Bengali coach is well portrayed with good use of light moments. In this phase, the best moments are when Dhoni gets to bat the first time. Instead of just focusing on his successful hits, the film focuses on the encouragement young Dhoni gets with each hit. The film brilliantly shows how one kid's passion for batting becomes a big hit in that local area in India. It was quite intriguing to see how Dhoni uses numerous cricket tournaments as a window of opportunity to take his game to the next level. However, Dhoni's journey to incredible success was quite arduous. There were no dearth of setbacks in this rocky road to becoming a legendary Indian cricketer. This untold story examines these lows and details Dhoni's reactions through these moments. It was increasingly fascinating to view Dhoni's emotions and how he emerges stronger after each major low in his life. In fact, it was quite interesting to see how calm MS Dhoni was during certain mishaps. For example, Dhoni's calmness during tense moments like missing the flight to the Dilip Trophy was brilliantly presented. In addition, the film splendidly recreates all of Dhoni's major successes including the 2011 World Cup. Ideally, it was increasingly special to view his family witness all his major matches via television. However, the moment that takes the cake is the grand finale which many Indians will love viewing. Basically, the 2011 world cup victory was a big moment and that finale by Dhoni is one that will touch many. Neeraj Pandey (the director of exceptional thrillers like Special 26 and Baby) has proved that he can make great films outside the thriller genre. His direction, screenplay, and dialogue is quite good. He exits his comfort zone and helms a biopic which hooks the audience till the climax. The film has a proper flow despite some unnecessary comedy (which is definitely fun to watch). Essentially, the film works due to a lack of snags. This picture does score in several other creative elements but the director successfully collaborates every element together. Basically, this biopic is a ship which did not sink like other ships because it had a highly skilled captain. If Tony D'Souza directed this film, it would've been far less effective like his Azhar(2016). Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an exceptional performance as Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He gets into the skin of the character and his enormous effort is clearly visible. This character has quite a few layers and Sushant demonstrates them with a high degree of success. In my honest opinion, his best scene was an incredibly difficult emotional breakdown. In this one moment, Dhoni is informed of his special someone's demise and it hits him really hard. Instead of hamming it up badly, Sushant keeps it real and portrays this heartbreaking moment brilliantly. The scenes where he has to juggle between exams and cricket are brilliantly enacted. In fact, you can actually observe the struggle period and his acting makes it more natural. Such moments make his triumphant victories even more beautiful. Disha Patani is sweet as Priyanka Jha and her importance in Dhoni's life is well explored. The beautiful lass underplays her role well. It is such a delight to see her genuine love for Dhoni and her demise is quite agonizing. Kiara Advani doesn't have a big part but she plays a pivotal role in Dhoni's life. Her romantic moments with Dhoni do distract a bit but they are beautiful to view. She has acted well despite the limited screen time; it would be wrong to deem this as a blink and miss appearance. Anupam Kher is excellent as Dhoni's father. His concerns for his son's future are realistic and he enacts these moments effectively. His best moments appear when he watches his sons highs and lows in the big cricket matches. However, his best scene is the finale in which we see his tears of joy for the grand victory. The rest of the cast are all effectively utilized as they all have important moments in the story. Amaal Mallik's music is great with some beautiful songs like Jab Tak and Besabriyaan. Arijit's Phir Kabhi strikes a chord for its lyrics as well as the excellent singing. Chiefly, the music has been beautifully crooned by the numerous musicians involved. On the whole, this is a great biopic which completely deserves all the love it got from the audience. It accurately presents the story of our Indian skipper and it does not shy away from the lows of his career. It is backed up by research and there is no major distortion of facts. Only a director of Neeraj Pandey's caliber could've pulled this off with such a great degree of triumph. \",\n",
       " ' The movie is awesome.The story was good.The story is on the life of ms dhoni and how he become a cricketer and his love story.Sushant singh rajput did a nice effort to be in the role of Ms Dhoni He acted awesome as Ms Dhoni.Direction wasgood by Neeraj Pandey.The screenplay was good.But only the editing was very bad.The movie should be around 2hr 20 mins but it is very long.Disha patani did not know how to act.The songs were nice.And the dialogues were good.A must watch movie for ms dhoni fans and also for those who loves cricket.But a must watch movie for everyone.

       " \" What kept going for me to watch this movie and recommend everyone to watch this aspiring documentary is justifying the title of Untold Story. I have watched Dhoni playing in Kharagpur when he was working for Indian railway. Knowing his personality and the way he used to handle pressure even then to those in final moments of World Cup was a daunting task for any actor to match. Sushant did a perfect justice to such a legend. You won't feel that you are watching a movie rather you will feel getting involved in it. This movie depicted that you can make a perfect recipe of success by your determination and your clarity of thoughts irrespective of what kind of imperfections are there in your individual skills. Dhoni might be not the best batsman in world, not the best wicket keeper in world, not the best captain in world when you go by stats but Dhoni is someone who brings the perfect recipe of yielding a result which his fans expect from him for his team.A would say it is a must watch if you want to treat it as a biography or documentary rather a movie. \",\n",
       " ' I was waiting for this movie from a long time now am very excited for this movie. You can say I am crazy for this movie. Everyone should watch this movie. Its not a movie it is a Motivational thought.Cricket is my passion but in the captaincy of MS Dhoni cricket become my love. So no doubt I am the fan of M S Dhoni. Sushant Singh Rajput played a beautiful role in this movie. people comparing Sushant with Dhoni but please everyone understand Dhoni is Dhoni no one else can get his place. ',\n",
       " ' I am a biggest fan of MS Dhoni but after watching this movie I become fan of Sushant Singh Rajput. What a great actor he is.

       " \" Interesting but still disappointed. The movie just gave a glimpse of just his emotional struggle. The story about his brother, his leadership qualities were all skipped. Many unnecessary parts could have been skipped. I'm sure people would have really enjoyed learning about the great man much more \",\n",
       " \" Apart from what other viewers have said I would like to mention just this.In this three hour long saga there are two classic throwaway scenes each lasting hardly a minute or so which actually make the total viewing experience so memorable.They are the visit of Dhoni's old Kharagpur friend and the other the surprise outing of Sakshi's pal. They balance each other as being perfect examples of pathos and joy! They have nothing to add to the plot.But they enrich the movie immeasurably. \",\n",
       " \" Thank you for this untold story. Dhoni story is so inspiring story for everyone. We can pick so many things and implement in our life. it shows how to be cool and cum and always positive in each and every situation, we know in life few bad times will come which we can't handle because we human, same happened with Mr. Captain and he broke up inside but soon he realize and move on.We should not stick to past life has to go on.

       " ' MS Dhoni:The Untold Story is a biographical film, based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.The movie starring SushantSingh Rajput ,Disha Patani ,Kiara Advani and Anupam Kher is directed by Neeraj Pandey. The Biopic is one of the most anticipated Bollywood Movies of This Year. If you are die-hard fan of MS Dhoni and cricket ,you are bound to love this film, which reverse its protagonist Spread over three hours, Dhoni: The Untold Story takes you through various events and places in the life of \"Mahi\", as everyone calls him in the movie. I have always been a Dhoni admirer. A movie on his life was an emotional, at times almost spiritual experience for me.Most importantly, the movie does not glorify Dhoni but shows him as a near-flawless character. Overall, it is an above-average performance if one looks at it in terms of accuracy and details. It is a simple story with an underlining message that you can be a small town boy but if you have talent and a little bit of luck, you can be unbridled. MS Dhoni:The movie follows the journey of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a budding cricketer from Ranchi, who became the most successful captain of the Indian Cricket Team. He was a ticket collector before he became a cricketer. The movie begins with the ICC Cricket World Cup Final (India vs Sri Lanka) in the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is watching the match live on screen. He decides to take the stand, and tells the authorities that he would go for batting if the wicket falls down. Dhoni takes up his bat and leads down the stairs interacted the roar of the crowd.The movie then goes into a flashback in Ranchi, Bihar in 1981, the year Dhoni was born. Dhoni\\'s alleged rivalry with Yuvraj Singh and a few senior players also finds a mention in the film.The Untold Story shows Dhoni\\'s love, struggles, rejections, luck, insights into his personality (including his most used words, definitely and process as well) and his rise in Indian cricket. Barring a minor glitch here and there, the movie manages to keep the viewers interested. The film has its flaws, misses here and there and falls a bit in the \\'death overs\\' ',\n",
       " \" I wasn't sure how this movie would be. In fact it was an excellent watch, holding the interest throughout.Biopics are not necessarily interesting and every celebrity or sportsperson's saga does not necessarily make for a good story. Dhoni's was superbly depicted, even for those who are not always cricket enthusiasts.The story played out well, the acting convinced, the sets were realistic, cinematography superb.The songs could have been avoided but the makers obviously needed to keep commercial interests in mind.All in all, this was a very good film and well worth watching. It is on hot star. \",\n",
       " \" Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport- biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.8½/10 \",\n",

The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story.Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions.Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh &amp; Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.at last, I am a Dhoni fan but this movie is beyond fans of Dhoni or fans of cricket... For general audience this will be a movie that's not just a treat but also a complete package. \",\n",

He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don't want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. Sushant was absolutely brilliant and flawless in the movie. this movie was not only an entertainer but also keeps you hooked to it for a good three hours. And rarely has a Bollywood movie been this good. There are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation and Hard Work. In last this is the best ever sports based films ever made. I \",\n",
       " ' Well people let me tell you something very important about each one of you who comment or posted their replyGood thing to know : 1. Every struggled person who realizes how hard he/she is been through his/her life will certainly make him/her tough and M.S. Dhoni is one of them but lets just admit he has a passion for cricket and so as everyone one of you has a passion for something, difference is if anyone has a guts to follow his passion and achieve all his goals. 2. Well it made me search too on google not because finding how she looks and all but because the girl in the movie acted simple which make us to think this is something sad has happened to someone who is good enough to follow his passion and bring glory to our country. Well i will not talk about human nature over here what people thinks or do at some situation which is what happening over here but if someone told you about it and no movie would have been made then I guess 70% wouldn\\'t have been so sorry about it. 3. Lets just assume that happens 80% of what we have seen in this movie but the producers should have selected the wrong series where both met in 2005 in a flight and India vs Pakistan match was ongoing. Let me tell you the result India(2)- Pakistan(4). India lost that series. Now, quoting dialogue from a movie \"Don\\'t bring anything for Valentine just win the series\". Well if this movie was to make someone inspired then at least producer should have thought about changing the series timeline. 4. My Thinking the movie: Movie was below average and was rushing as if director\\'s or producer\\'s main focus was to show \"There is always a woman in a success of every man\" but I didn\\'t see anything if expand the facts(Losing series). 5. Overall : MS Dhoni for me is a man who made us proud by winning both format world cup. He is not some heart-broken silly person lets be real now. He has a passion for cricket and works hard enough for it. I am not only proud of MS dhoni but I am saluting to all those guys who has a passion and work for it really hard until they get it because I am not that person to have guts like that. His struggle and toughness made him so successful since he had to deal with lots of stupid selectors or Cricket Board. My real life story sucks more than this, the thing is there is no movie made on my life. Now see how following passion gifts you with delights. Go and follow your Dream! Your story will also be shown to the world. **Note **: Now when I say passion or dream this shouldn\\'t had to be like \"I want to be best programmer in my company\" don\\'t lie to yourself, i am not saying this can\\'t be your dream but I know people lie to themselves sometimes and that\\'s where you become the biggest failure more than me. Thank you Guys! Be real Be you! ',\n",
       " \" This is one of the best movies of Bollywood I've ever seen. The film was executed very well and each and every moment I was very much intrigued. It was so good to watch and I never knew what he had to go through. At first I had doubts about casting Sushant Singh Rajput as M.S. Dhoni. But after watching this movie I was very much mesmerised at his performance. I felt that M.S. Dhoni himself was going through all this again. I felt that M.S. Dhoni himself was going through all this again. His performance was so good that I never felt that he was acting as M.S. Dhoni but he was M.S. Dhoni himself.For the full review visit: https://goo.gl/tjbTLM \",\n",
       " ' I have been someone who grew into the enigma of MS Dhoni. It started with a lot off apprehension on his unconventional methods and unexpected tactical decisions as captain. But then luck can be once or twice, genius has consistency. But what set Dhoni apart was not his cricketing prowess. It was his mental strength while pulling of those last over rescue operations day in and day out. The nerves of steel shown while defending small scores. And the ability to bring out the best from young players. So as a fan of both MS &amp; Neeraj Pandey what I expected was the movie would explore this inner journey of the Man. What he speaks to himself while chasing 19 off 6 balls. What does he tell his bowlers during the nail biting finishes. How does he make decisions? by elimination? by intuition? or something else? Something that Chak De India - Movie did brilliantly. It misses the crucial point of how he was appointed the captain. How did the selectors make that decision. No where did we get to see how the character evolved as a leader. The movie turns out to be plain vanilla in terms of its treatment. Borders on too much self indulgence at times. Is painfully long. And as rightly put by my friend Bharath Reddy Ravuru the second half seems like a highlight package of his popular innings. I somehow could not connect with the character and root for him which i did say in case of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Paan Singh Tomar or for that matter even Sultan in spite of knowing the obvious climax. Only saving grace are the honest performances. Otherwise nothing great. ',\n",
       " ' So finally Bollywood has entered big time in the biopic business with films like Mary Kom, Azhar and MS Dhoni. Clearly, \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story\" stands much higher on the pedestal. The movie unfolds brilliantly in flashback with Dhoni\\'s childhood innocence mixed with ambitiousness. His struggle to get ahead of the crowd in cricket, life\\'s challenges, friendships and emotions beautifully depicted in the first part. The way Dhoni faced several setbacks depicted why he is considered \"Captain Cool\" in the cricket fraternity because it is not just cricket, it is the way Dhoni has lived his entire life. The way his school sports teacher supported him showed not only his passion but also the vigour with which an average Indian follows cricket. Although, the second half was a bit of let down. The two love stories were stretched unnecessarily. Our directors need to understand that every movie does not need hero and heroine to sing and dance hand in hand. That part could have been curtailed. First half created a sound base with Dhoni\\'s struggle and entry into national team. But Dhoni\\'s skills, his thinking style, his handling of pressure situations could have been further explored. What goes through Dhoni\\'s mind under crunch situations was not shown. The movie could have gone further in cricket technicalities and shown how Dhoni calculates a particular situation.Overall, a great movie. Movies like this will help boost sports in India and encourage youngsters to pursue career in sports. But our movie makers need to learn a bit on biopic making. This movie goes for a 8 rating but I have rated it 9 out of my passion for cricket and admiration of MS Dhoni as a player and I want more and more people to watch this movie. ',\n",
       " ' I really enjoyed watching the biopic of one of the greatest ODI players that India has produced \\x96 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (lovingly called as Mahi). Since it is biopic one should not expect it to be presented in the same manner as a conventional film. I wasn\\'t aware of a few things in his life which I got to see in the film.The film captures Mahi\\'s life from his childhood onwards. But it does not show anything on the goings-on in the dressing room or his relationship with team mates or his growth as a cricketer in the Indian team.MERITS OF M. S. Dhoni:The Untold Story 1 \\x96 The pacing of the film &amp; plot development is very good.2 \\x96 The background music is thrilling.3 \\x96 The special effects look absolutely real! Especially the special make-up effect of Sushant Singh Rajput who is shown to have a very thin physique (including a thin face) while depicting Dhoni during his school days.More spectacular is Sushant\\'s presence in real cricket footage shaking hands and embracing other members of the cricket team, after winning the 2011 ODI Cricket World Cup.That to me looked totally real! 4 - Sushant Singh Rajput batting looked very convincing, esp. the Helicopter shot (originally called the \"thapad shot\"). In addition, his imitation of the Dhoni walk and body language was perfect.5 \\x96 The film has maintained authenticity in terms of the kind of locations in which Mahi has grown up in.6 \\x96 Bhumika Chawla (played sister of Mahi), Kiara Advani (played Sakshi Malik) and Disha Patani are good actresses.Interestingly, Disha Patani looks very much like Shradha Kapoor! Loved her gorgeous &amp; infectious smile! 7 \\x96 Actor Herry Tangri who played Yuviraj Singh looks almost like Yuvi.DEMERITS OF M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story 1 \\x96 For some strange reason the special make-up effect was not applied on Anupam Kher to make him look a young father during Mahi\\'s childhood days.All that he had was a black wig. But with heavy eye-bags he looked very old.2 \\x96 The ad shoots of Mahi were shown arbitrarily without any link with the normal flow of the story. This did not look right.3 \\x96 MSD was never shown to kiss or properly embrace the 2 girls he had fallen in love with. Very strange! 4 \\x96 May be the film was a bit too long (3 hrs 10 mins).On second thoughts, may be it has to be; otherwise it will miss out on important things in Mahi\\'s life.PS: Sad thing is that I saw 8 people leave the cinema hall after 2 hours. I guess they got bored and left. What were they expecting - Mahi bulldozing several villains and doing bike stunts? ',\n",
       " ' The film is about the life of cricketer Mahendra Singh as a boy, progressing into teenager and finally as an adult. It shows how he rose above all obstacles to achieve greatness. The film also looks into his personal relationships with the only two women in his life - one who he lost to a tragedy: the late Priyanka Jha and the other who he later met eventually became his wife, Sakshi Rawat.The film starts with Dhoni\\'s birth. Later we see him as a boy in school training as a goalkeeper. A teacher(who is also a school cricket coach) spots him and notices his goalkeeping ability and immediately realizes what a good wicket-keeper he would be, given the proper training. He calls Dhoni, who at first is reluctant, but then agrees for a trial. At the trial, he impresses his coach and finally agrees to full-time training. Dhoni\\'s father objects to his concentrating more on cricket rather than focusing his attention on his studies. He eventually goes against his dad\\'s wishes to embark on a career that can only be described as \"magical\". The film shows the hardships faced by Indian cricketers. We also see the choices faced by the I.C.C.(Indian Cricket Council) when choosing the right cricket player for the Indian team and the politics involved. M.S. Dhoni was among a batch of players that included another legend Yuvraj Singh. Eventually their partnership in cricket would be lethal and a key for the success of the Indian cricket team.No doubt, a lot of other players contributed to the Cricket World Cup 2011 win: Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Harbhajan Singh and Ravichandran Ashwin among many others. (Full Lineup: http:// www.espncricinfo.com /icc_cricket_worldcup2011 /content /squad /497114.html)Neeraj Pandey has already captured Bollywood\\'s attention with films like A Wednesday(2008), Special 26(2013), The Royal Bengal Tiger(2014) and Baby(2015). Sushant Singh Rajput plays the role of Dhoni very well and veteran actor Anupam Kher plays the role of Dhoni\\'s father. The photography of the film is superb along with the direction and background music. The songs in the film are also decent.Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper. ',\n",
       " \" First the teaser, then trailer and after that movie all were absolutely awesome.Really an amazing movie which really inspire one, that to work hard, fight against all odds, and choose decision by yourself only. The story of Legend Indian WordCup winning captain. Beautiful story of MSD,a great direction by Neeraj Pandey. Also wonderful acting by Sushant Singh Rajput, he did justice totally with MSD Character. Its an aspiring more than Rocky. You should watch it. All other cast were also really good. A complete movie and truly should be in one's collection.Hats off to all MSD movie members. Also huge respect to MSD.A must watch. \",\n",
       " ' An amazing movie. Everyone knows the story of M S Dhoni and what he has achieved for India in cricket. But this film is more about how he started liking the game and pursued it as a career. The story is all about his struggles of getting selected into the Indian team and what all troubles he faced in becoming a star and won us the prestigious 2011 cricket world cup.Sushanth Singh Rajput is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. He performs so well that you will feel as if Dhoni himself has acted in his biopic. The way Sushanth has mastered the cricketing skills and imitated Dhoni completely in the game is just outstanding. Not only with the appearance, Sushanth gives an emotional performance and holds you onto the screen right until the end.Special mention should go to the VFX team for showcasing the grounds, cricket matches, and Sushanth in such a splendid way. The Ending of the movie surely give you goosebumps. AmazingM S Dhoni is one name which will be remembered in India for the rest of our lives. His rise to fame and the actual struggles he faced to get where he is now is an inspiration in itself. ',\n",
       " ' Really happy to share my views on M.S.Dhoni:The untold story.Truelly speaking this movie is superb and inspiring a lot of youth to sustain on one Goal for long.This movie showed us not to give up your dreams what come may.taught us that if u r really passionate about your dream then nobody can stop you to reach at the pinnacle of your field.I hope this movie will inspire many youths.This story showed us that sometimes you have to sacrifice everything to reach at your goal.simply what message I get from this movie is \"Do what you love and give everything for your dream \" but remember God always in any situation.Hoping you will also like this movie,so don\\'t forget to watch it. Thank you very much Ankush ',\n",
       " \" Biopics are a different genre altogether. They cannot be classified as romantic, drama or comedy. They depict someone's life events which have different phases. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's biopic is no different.As is said by one of the most respectable directors of Hollywood, biopics are the easiest way to cheat creativity. The very core of a creative piece is compromised by simply putting true events of a person's life one after another. But if the person is an influential figure, then the film is a treat to its fans.M.S.Dhoni - The Untold Story, which had created hypes all over by its trailers, delivers an average output. The film depicts the highs and lows of the Indian skipper and clearly shows how captain cool was born. With non linear storytelling being the favorite of every director, Neeraj Pandey preferred a linear pattern right from school days to the winning moment in the history of Indian cricket. Some of the dialogues make an impact on the youth and influences them to take a strong hold on their decision about their passion. What fails to impact is the craft of film making itself. With Neeraj Pandey, donning the director's hat, the expectation for a better screenplay is high. Moreover, few important life stories seem missing (e.g. how he became the captain for the first time). Although the promos clearly say that the film is about the 'journey you don't' know, the missing links could have knitted the film in an appropriate manner.This film clearly points out at the amateur level special effects that we have and at the same time hints at the potential of the same in a subtle way. Although I am no hair expert, but the wig of long hair,as shown in the initial days of Dhoni, is a bit annoying.The cast of the film is apt. Anupam Kher is a perfect choice as this man is an institution of acting and can portray any role and can get into anyone's shoes. Bhumika Chawla and Rajesh Sharma acts quite strongly as the characters seem to be in Dhoni's life. I am gradually becoming a fan of Kumud Mishra, whose on screen presence and dialogue delivery is charismatic. And of course, a guest appearance by Kiran More as himself, is a delight to watch.The biggest challenge of a biopic is for the actors whose creative freedom is curtailed as they have to enact a personality as close to perfection so that the audience is convinced. Sushant Singh Rajput's hard work is evident and shows how much he came close to Dhoni's body language. The scenes from the matches are clear indication of how far this actor has gone to prepare himself. The helicopter shot and the World Cup winning shots are as good as Dhoni himself. Disha Patani steals the thunder from Kiara Advani, long after her on screen time in the film ends. No wonder she has more projects lined up in the future. Probably the best cast in recent few years of Indian cinema is that of Henry Tangiri, as Yuvraj Singh. This actor was born for this role and I wished I had seen more of him in the film.The music is pretty mediocre especially with Ae Dil Hain Mushkil, ready for release, which is giving away one hit song after another.The story of the most successful captain of Indian cricket team is indeed an inspiration for all. Certainly things were not easy for Mahi, yet he made his way through. Although this is not Neeraj Pandey's best work, you will still want to cheer on many occasions in this film.Probably the last clip is where you will want to shout out loud the most.'Dhoni finishes in style...' \",\n",
       " ' A must watch film for every cricketer and every cricket fan and every die hard MS Dhoni fan can boldly , proudly celebrate the untold story and the hard work of MS Dhoni made me more emotional and Sushant Singh deserves a National award this year he completely stolen the show his screen presence and body language made film more enlighten. Really great massive super duper hit blockbuster movie !! Hats Off Neeraj sir, Sushanth and our very own lovely MS Dhoni sir you are legend1st half : Interesting Screenplay, Very Good { Introduced as Football Goal Keeper in school turned out as batsmen and district player in the 1st half along with his schooling and RRB job}2nd half : Goose Bumps Guaranteed, Massive Hit {urns out into full time cricketer with love sequences, Captain Cool arises with Helicopter shots and Ups and Downs in team shows the real MS Dhoni characterization, Sushant Nailed it really } ',\n",
       " \" M.S Dhoni - the untold story - It seems as if the makers have not altered or exaggerated any element of M.S. Dhoni's life for the purpose of making the movie more viewer friendly, which makes it a genuine biopic. Something to be appreciated. In terms of acting, I would say Sushant Singh Rajut did an extremely good work, and so did the young actor who played M.S. Dhoni as a kid. The director has convincingly captured the atmosphere of the place where Dhoni grew up. The middle class family, the city of Ranchi etc. Things change as the movie progresses to the second half post intermission. In the second half, the director gets engrossed in linking the movie with clips of actual games in which Dhoni has played. A lot of screen time is devoted to filming the game on ground as it would appear in late 1990s when viewed on the television and they have also edited footage of the game so that it seems that Sushant Singh Rajput (who is supposed to be Dhoni) is on the field with players like Yuvraj Singh and Tendulkar (not actors playing the part, but the players themselves). In the attempt to concentrate on this, I feel the director missed out on some interesting and important bits. For example - I would like to see more about the process when Dhoni was selected to be the captain or when Dhoni was selected in the Indian team itself. As far as the captaincy is concerned, the movie does not dwell on it all - there is one scene when Dhoni is an player in the team and in the next scene he is the captain. At the time of his selection in the Indian team, there is about 2 minutes of screen time but no emphasis is given to the process of his selection. Also, there is the time when Dhoni is not selected in the team but Yuvraj Singh is because Yuvraj Singh is a much better player and Dhoni says that he needs to practice more - however, there is nothing about how he practices or the steps he takes to make his game better. I would have also liked to see more about his relationship with Sakshi or how his fame changed the dynamics between his friends back home etc. I would have liked to see why he took the decision to change the batting order in the World cup game which they finally won. The director spends less than 10 seconds to show the media created controversies between Dhoni and other players, I would have liked to see more about the implications of these rumors. The movie is titled M.S. Dhoni - the untold story - but everything shown are common known facts about Dhoni's life - the untold story would be to show how Dhoni felt/reacted at the time he was going through these events, his strategy decisions and blunders.All in all, at 3 hours and 4 mins, this is pretty long movie. Inspite of that, it seems the director kept on cutting sub-plots in the middle due to lack of time. I feel a little less screen time on filming/editing Sushant Singh Rajput in with real players and more screen time for the actual story would have helped. In its current form, the second half of the movie feels more like a documentary. A good documentary, but a documentary nonetheless. \",\n",
       " \" M.S.Dhoni: The Untold Story is a film like many other bollywood films which has a promising first half and becomes disappointing in the second half. Its almost like we are watching 2 films before and after intermission. The first half is extremely well made which shows the hardships Dhoni had to face in getting selected to the Indian team. Sushant Singh Rajput does really well in presenting the character's determination as well as his frustrations in his journey in becoming a successful cricketer. I guess these parts really shows the dark side of being a sportsman in our country. The compromises one has to make in following your passions. It's only after the intermission that the film gets tedious and boring with nothing much to tell about what the character is going through besides his 2 love affairs. It's sad that the writing gets poor in the second half that even Rajput's potential is not utilized as well as in the early portions of the movie. My rating is 6/10 \",\n",
       " \" More five-day Test than Twenty20 blast, Neeraj Pandey's hefty Hindi biopic seizes upon the Indian cricket captain as a long-haired, motorbike-riding poster boy for the country's modernisation. This MS Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) strides out with logo-emblazoned bat on to a succession of pitches incrementally grander than the one his humble engineer father (Anupam Kher) struggled to water; even his erratic development \\x96 stuck checking train tickets after a promising student career \\x96 seems somehow tied to the state and fate of the nation.Any Boycottian analysis would rule certain aspects a tad daft \\x96 there probably wouldn't be so many midwicket musical montages in The Andrew Strauss Story \\x96 and the tone is somewhere between understandably fond and fawning. Still, the on-field activity is convincing, and Rajput makes MSD a winning mix of eyes-on-the-prize focus, square-jawed stoicism and quiet humility.Pandey holds this career up as cause for communal celebration, and his film has the big-match temperament to set us cheering \\x96 or, in this Englishman's case, politely applauding. \",\n",
       " \" The movie revolves around India's most sorted out captain Mahendra singh dhoni. the pace of the movie is fast and it keeps the audiences engaged for the first half however a little boredom is introduced in the second half. There are very few things or rather not at all anything which is included in the movie and we don't know.The actors have performed really well whether it is disha patnani playing a short role or sushant singh rajput himself playing M.S. Dhoni 9/10 goes for the acting.All in all a one time watch family movie which is inspiring in its own sense. highly recommended. \",\n",
       " ' First half is about Dhoni\\'s childhood and struggle to get a chance in \"Men in blue\". But in a second half, film disappoint us. It is more about Dhoni\\'s love stories, rather than his tenure as captain of Indian cricket team. He has been honored by making biopic because of his success in cricket. And in a three-hour lengthy film, the director has hardly captured the soul of cricket. The scene, about his rivalry with Yuvraj Singh while under 19 team selection is really good. After becoming Indian Team Captain, his relations with senior as well as junior players, strategies behind big wins should have been given weight rather than his personal life. Dhoni is one of the best wicket-keepers in the world. He is known for unorthodox skills in wicket keeping, But in the film, the focus is on only batting tenure.After watching the trailer, I had doubts about the performance of Sushant Rajput as a Dhoni. (Just intuition). But he has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly.Sushant Singh didn\\'t have to act for on-field scenes. Special effect team has worked very well by mixing Sushant\\'s face to Dhoni\\'s body in actual cricket matches. It is a shortcut for showing realistic scenes but worked well.Hey Guys... Check My review on most awaited movie.. M.S. Dhoni.. Please share if you like..http://vishalwords.blogspot.in/2016/10/ms-dhoni-still-untold- story.html ',\n",
       " ' First things first: How is the movie: Not good (When I compare it to the likes of Cinderella Man, Pele, Fighter and so on.)We are presented with same old multiple times told story of a common man to exceptional man. Its portrayed as Untold Story with a label of a great player over it and VIOLA - People going gaga over it like its one of the best biopic ever. But its nowhere even close to what it should have been.What is wrong with the movie?LOVE SONG - The only thing that pops in my mind is \"WHY??\". Why there has to be a love song every time. Why can\\'t it be a real life romantic situation where characters are more believable. Instead of wasting 5 minutes over a futile song, it could have been used for better character and situation development.INNOVATION - It lacks innovation in terms of direction and cinematography. Portrayal of intense sequences limited only to Slow Motion camera work with a person standing in front of it and totally confused if he/she should shed tears (and look weak) or not (and look strong). Its accompanied with a typical Bollywood background score that desperately attempts to squeeze out a few teardrops, but fails.THE UNTOLD STORY - As the title suggests, the focus of the whole deal should have never been a series of events that happened in the life of MS Dhoni. Its already known what events occurred in his life or one can simply google it. The real untold would have been - What crossed Dhoni\\'s mind when he was hit by tough situations? How the world looked through his eyes when he was struggling? Unfortunately the movie fails terribly to tell this untold aspect of a great player.REAL LIFE FOOTAGES - There is nothing wrong with footage (Apart from poor VFX), but the problem is that it gets extremely repetitive after a while. Its like watching 2 couples of typical Dhoni shots over and over again for some 40 minutes - which in my opinion is not very gripping.After 3 hours and 5 minutes, when I came out of the theater with a minor headache, it felt like the Director Neeraj Pandey ran out of ideas pretty much in the early stages of the production and decided to juggle between real life cricket clips, love scenes and day to day events in Dhoni\\'s life. Tragically the juggling din\\'t go well and all the juggling balls got floored. All in all the movie deserves no more than 5.0/10.0 ',\n",
       " \" Acting was good. This movie would have been a great Indian Biopic if they have concentrated more on making cricket playing scenes realistic. Not even close to the cricket scenes in Lagaan. I love sports movies mostly due to inspiring game scenes, attitude,team bonding, etc. but all are missing during the game. All the ingredients are present in Mr. Dhoni's life and director failed to capture those which would been highly inspiring for the youngsters. Also the director thinks Mr. Dhoni knows only to hit boundaries something like book cricket we used to play at school. Overall the movie was good excluding the cricket scenes. \",\n",
       " \" MS Dhoni movie had a great premise. The story of one of the most popular cricketer in India. MS Dhoni has struggled early in his career to achieve success. Dhoni had his mercurial success in a short span of time. And the records speaks of it. In his road to success, Dhoni had his fair shared of controversies. After all Indian Cricket is always front page news all the time.As far as the movie goes, the first half captures aptly his struggles and frustrations in life. Unlike Yuvraj Singh,Dhoni had to work his way to the top. The first half is the best part of the movie and Neeraj Pandey nailed it perfectly.The trouble started in the 2nd half where Dhoni enters Indian Team. The movie clearly stays safe away from controversies and conflicts with teammates. It does not give any any inroads to what Dhoni thinks in those controversial times. My guess is that Neeraj Pandey started with the right intent but end up making a superficial content to keep Dhoni happy and content. Also there might be objections from BCCI and players like Yuvraj Singh, Viraat Kohli, Virendra Shehwag etc. It is very difficult to make a biopic of a living legend. Hence it left the movie high and dry.Also to make the matter, the unnecessary introduction of love interest ( 2 of them). The subplot of love life of Dhoni brought the pace of the movie to a complete halt. Neeraj Pandey is not good with romantic scenes ( its a Karan Johar zone), we saw the example in his previous movies like Baby and Special26.Great performances from Sushant Singh Rajput( the best of his career till date!).Finally the length of the movie was 3hr 5mins. That was awfully long.The movie is a mass movie capturing the best cricketing moments of Dhoni in his career. They are memorable and people will definitely love it. It will surely be a blockbuster.But definitely it is not Neeraj Pandey's best! \",\n",
       " \" My MS DHONI reviewWith so many great cricketers in our country, why choose Dhoni for a biopic? Well, he might not have the best technique or the best records but he has always been a natural. He is a gladiator, a smiling assassin, a cool headed general who is silently aggressive. True, he does not win all his gambles but he always dares and has been instrumental in changing the team's fortunes. It is his imperfection and iconic yet 'every-man' identity which has captured the imagination of a cricket crazy nation. Coupled with this is the fact, that his story from his very humble background when he was least interested in cricket to becoming one of the most popular faces in the sport is both interesting and awe-inspiring.The first half is fresh and engrossing telling us about a young Dhoni's initiation into cricket as a boy, his simple life in a small, laid back town, how he started making a name for himself with friends and well wishers rallying around him, his missed opportunities, how he landed a job of a TTE in Railways (on the strength of his talent alone) and how he finally chucked the job to play full time cricket. Sadly, the second half fails to sustain the momentum. One can clearly make out that the producers and Dhoni did not wish to court controversy when the names of senior players(suggested to be dropped by Dhoni) are muted in the conversation between Dhoni and the selectors. While some might say that it takes away the spice from the plot, personally, I am okay with it. A movie 'does not have' to be controversial to be good!Having said that, not portraying any other major player, no changing room banter and no on field chatter are absolutely major flaws in the script. The slightly longer (than required) footage for both of Dhoni's love interests and the songs slow down the pace and distract the viewer. The ample use of real match clips with SUSHANT's face morphed on Dhoni's body is both good and bad. Good because it lends a certain air of authenticity to the script and Bad because beyond a certain point, it seems repetitive and documentary like. SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT with his mild voice and average looks does not really fit into the conventional Bollywood hero mould but he manages to get by. Here as MS DHONI, he has essayed the role really well and this is by far his best performance. His unassuming dialogue delivery and controlled emotions are in tune with the character and he stays within the limits of his abilities. His well rehearsed accent doesn't sound fake and he has successfully replicated Dhoni's playing style, stance and mannerisms. ANUPAM KHER can walk through such roles with his eyes closed. Needless to say, he does a good job as Dhoni's father but is so predictable that somehow he fails to excite.RAJESH SHARMA follows up his wonderful performances in Ishqiya, Tanu Weds Manu Returns and Special 26 with another flawless act as Dhoni's first coach. KUMUD MISHRA delivers a swell performance close on the heels of his neat portrayal as Salman's coach in SULTAN. The actor who plays AK Ganguly, the Railways Boss (who is also a cricket enthusiast), is so much into his character that one cannot make out that he is acting. Both DISHA PATANI (as Dhoni's first girlfriend) and KIARA ADVANI (as Sakshi Dhoni) look pretty, do not overact and give fair performances.The movie celebrates Dhoni's uplifting life story and the passion for the game without being in-your-face. It gives hope that even a small town boy can make it big given the talent and support (and timely luck, of course). The common man can identify with him because DHONI, the star, is 'Humanly' Superhuman. Had it not been for the flaws, the film could have been like Dhoni........calm and understated yet\\x85\\x85\\x85\\x85..brutally effective. The movie is definitely watchable. Even as I am writing this, the weekend box office collection is crossing 60 crores\\x85\\x85\\x85Ab\\x85(D)HONI ko kaun taal sakta hai !! Sameer Singh Thapa \",\n",

WHAT? GO AND WATCH To create a true, full-blooded biopic, filmmakers need a free-hand: MS Dhoni The Untold Story, which claims to give us Mahendra Singh Dhoni Uncut, is much more generous with details from his childhood and his days of struggle than from his blazing tenure as star wicketkeeper-batsman-captain of the Indian cricket team.The result, with the exception of a few interesting bits and pieces, is bland and predictable. The over-long film cherry-picks the details it wants to serve us, skirting all grey areas and controversies: there are no smart nose-digs, only ingratiating bouquets; only hurrahs (the critique is so muted that we can barely hear it), and loud background music which is used to drum up emotion and drama. \",\n",
       " ' MS Dhoni - The Untold Story - My Rating - 3.5/5 As a Cricket fan, As a Dhoni fan and critic, you will absolutely love this movie and probably become a fan of Sushant Singh. But as a cinema fan and a Neeraj Pandey fan, its probably not his best movie, but best 1st half. There are 2 movies in this 1 movie. Before interval, it shows Dhoni\\'s struggle in cricket right from his childhood in an Indian middle class family where the only important thing is a \"Good Job\". 2nd half, its all about the actual Dhoni that we already know, Fast 100s, 2007 and 2011 World cups and love life. You\\'ll feel goosebumps on key Moments, and its not just because of Dhoni, its because of Sushant. You can see his hard preparation for the role that he has actually played the exact replica of him. His batting style, his walking style, and even not showing emotion to anyone but you can feel that its there. Amazing Performance.Of course, 2nd half winning moments made me feel nostalgic but it was just events after events happening, like they show the relationship with Sakshi and then marriage and then suddenly Dhoni hits a six and wins the World cup. There\\'s no connection or lead up to the big event. Also, makes the movie tooooooo long, like 3 hrs 10 mins long.Also, someone played Yuvi, Bhai ne leli Dhoni ki, ek hi scene me. Kiran More was there as Kiran More, and he is the worst actor ever. The two actresses did what they could, smile smile smile \"Dhoni I love you\" n stuff. Good use of CGI putting Sushant\\'s face everywhere in all intl. matches.Its a must watch for Sushant Singh, and for Dhoni of course. ',\n",
       " ' Watched M s dhoni... along with his billions of admirers i also went to watch it with huge expectations.. but the question is... are my expectations fulfilled?? The ans is a big No...!!!! why?? I\\'ll try to give the answers... but u have to read this post with patience.. firstly i must let u know that i am a die hard fan of four famous persons.. &amp; they are... 1. the god of cricket, 2. the captain cool 3. The king of romance &amp; 4. The Mozart of madras .... &amp; this movie deals with of my idols i.e. the captain cool(by the way i am the fan of the finisher &amp; captain dhoni not a fan of lover dhoni)... so... as a die hard fan i know almost every damn thing about him whatever TV has broadcast-ed and internet has published all through these years... what i didn\\'t know was the inside stories.... no no no... i m not talking about controversies... after watching numerous biopics i knew very well that there will be no controversial sequences in this movie also... i am a matured movie goer u know...!! By saying inside stories i meant what was running inside my most beloved captains head in numerous occasions like after getting sudden captaincy before 2007t20wc &amp; how did he prepare himself mentally for that or what did he think before giving the final over to joginder sharma in the final of the same WC or what was going through his mind before promoting himself up in the wc2011 final despite having poor form throughout the tournament(i knew he promoted himself up because i have watched the match many times and if i want to revisit those priceless moments then youtube is there for me.... all i wanted to know was.. why did he do so?? How did he get the confidence?? What was he thinking at that moment??? I went to watch this movie only to find the answers of these questions &amp; to live those moments once again as well) and of course i wanted to know about his struggles right from his childhood days... the first half of the movie has managed to answer my last question by showing his earlier struggles brilliantly... but the 2nd half fails to answer my other questions miserably... how he became the greatest finisher??? How he became captain cool?? What motivated him to do such wonders while finishing matches or how did he manage to make the boldest of decisions as a captain?? What made him one of the finest match readers???? These questions remained unanswered... may be the director also thinks that msd is the \"most luckiest captain\" may be that\\'s why he didn\\'t bother to show the inside stories &amp; dedicated the second half to his love life entirely... but Mr neeraj pandey u should know that these are the things(not his love life) which made msd the best finisher or the captain cool... so neeraj pandey gets a big zero from me despite making a brilliant 1st half... i m totally disappointed with his work in the 2nd half &amp; with this movie as well...!! The only good thing of this movie is... the performances of all the actors... but among all of them the immensely talented sushant singh rajput shines and shines like the mighty sun... he delivers his 200% in this movie... got a role of a lifetime &amp; nailed it completely... hats off to his dedication... he was more than perfect in each &amp; every frame... enjoyed his performance through out the movie... in fact he was the only reason why i glued to the seat till the end... deserves 100/100 for his epic performance...!!!!So the bottom line is... m s dhoni the movie provides \"untold story\" in the first half and \"told &amp; exaggerated story\" in the second half... overall... a disappointing movie..!!And to finish it off in style(like msd) i would like to add a few more lines... if u have read this damn lengthy post completely &amp; still survived then its alright.... but if u didn\\'t.... then i must say this movie is 3hrs &amp; 15mins long which is much much much more lengthy than this one... how will you survive that?????? :) :) ']"
